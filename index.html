      The Story:<br />
      <br />
      Bob is working as a bus driver. However, he has become extremely popular
      <br />
      amongst the city's residents. With so many passengers wanting to get
      aboard <br />
      his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on
      <br />
      the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be
      <br />
      able to fit all the passengers.<br />
      <br />
      Task Overview:<br />
      <br />
      You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:<br />
      <br />
      cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.<br />
      on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.<br />
      wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the
      <br />
      driver. If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the
      <br />
      number of passengers he can't take.<br />
      <br />
      Usage Examples:<br />
      <br />
      cap = 10, on = 5, wait = 5 --> 0 # He can fit all 5 passengers<br />
      cap = 100, on = 60, wait = 50 --> 10 # He can't fit 10 of the 50
      waiting<br />
